# Mutiny

## A tiny, open source, microphone muting app for MacOS

Mute your microphone at the system level with the tap of a custom shortcut or a click in your status bar.

Has an optional sound and overlay to give feedback on toggle.

This was inspired by and some components were adapted from many similar apps that came before it, but I brought together a few new things to this project to make it work for me. 

## Installation 
- Download the app.zip on the [release page](https://github.com/matthewweldon/Mutiny/releases/tag/1.1), drag to applications (or another folder if you're like that)
or
- Download the project and compile yourself with XCode!

## Usage 
- Runs in the status bar, 
- left click the icon to mute/unmute your current default input device (microphone),
- right click then click preferences to edit the hotkey for mute, (I use f13)

This software is provided without warranty or gaurentee of any kind.

This is a tiny little free app, but if you desperately want to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/matthewweldon), then I would happily take it.
